# Simple C rlImgui, cimgui, imgui and raylib example project template

This is a simple template I have created mostly for myself for using raylib with imgui in C.

1) get the stuff
```console
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui
git clone https://github.com/raylib-extras/rlImGui
git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
```

2) compile
```console
make
```

## cleaning

```console
make clean
```

Edit the Makefile as you please.

## License

There is no license, take it, I just wrote a Makefile.
