# Simple C rlImgui, cimgui, imgui and raylib example project template

This is a simple template I have created mostly for myself for using raylib with imgui in C.

## Building

compile

```console
make
```

clean

```console
make clean
```

Edit the Makefile as you please.

## License

There is no license, take it, I just wrote a Makefile.
